 This is a 20 key keypad with really REALLY bright lights!

 This board has 12 4960 Neopixel LED's. they are all facing down for a massive aount of under glow if I make a white 3D printed case for it, or I can just use it as a searchlight. 

The keypad PCB has 2 brakepoints so it can be snapped off and then connected with a right angle header.

this also acts as a sort of stand for the keypad if you dont make a case for it.
